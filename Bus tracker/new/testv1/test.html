            Adjust transform for the triangle's actual visual center relative to its bounding box.
            For a border-bottom triangle (point up), its visual center is typically
            at 50% left, and around 1/3 of its height from the base (or 2/3 from the tip).
            To center the *base* of the triangle at the body's center, use translate(-50%, 0%).
            To center the *tip* of the triangle at the body's center, use translate(-50%, -100%).
            To center the *geometric center* (centroid) of the triangle, you need to calculate:
            The height of the triangle is 120px (border-bottom width).
            The centroid is at 1/3 of the height from the base. So, 120px / 3 = 40px from base.
            Since the triangle points up, its base is at the bottom of its 0x0 div.
            So, to move its centroid to the center, you need to shift it up by (120px / 2) - 40px = 60px - 40px = 20px
            Or more simply, the centroid is 2/3 of the height from the tip. So, 2/3 * 120px = 80px from the tip.
            If the tip is at 'top: 50%', then you shift it down by 80px relative to its top-left corner.
            This can be confusing. The easiest is often to center the entire bounding box and adjust visually.
            Let's aim to center the *base* of the triangle at the same center point as the circle for now.
            */
            transform: translate(-50%, 0%); /* Centers the triangle's base horizontally, keeps its base at top:50% */
            /* If you want the triangle to point 'down' from the circle, you might do: */
            /* transform: translate(-50%, calc(100% + 10px)); */ /* 100% moves its base down, +10px for gap */


            /* To make the triangle start with its point at the very top of the circle,
               and have its base extend downwards, we need to adjust its position and rotation. */
            /* Let's adjust the transform-origin and then position */
            transform-origin: 50% 0%; /* Set origin to the top center of the triangle's bounding box (its point) */
            /* Then position its origin point to the center of the body */
            top: 50%;
            left: 50%;
            transform: translate(-50%, -50%); /* Adjust to move triangle's bounding box's top-left to center */

            /* Now, fine-tune position for the triangle itself.
               The 'point' of the border-bottom triangle is at the top of its 0x0 content box.
               Its height is 120px (border-bottom).
               So, to get its point to the center, we move its bounding box's top-left to center
               and then translate it by half its width, and its full height UP.
            */
            transform: translate(-50%, -100%); /* Centers horizontally, moves up by full height to put tip at (50%, 50%) */
            /* This makes the triangle's point perfectly centered. */
            z-index: 2; /* Triangle on top of circle */
        }

        .triangle:hover {
            /* Now, when rotated, it will rotate around its own point which is centered */
            transform: translate(-50%, -100%) rotate(90deg); /* Maintain initial translation for centering */
